    <h2> How To Befriend a Polar Bear ü•∞</h2>
 In order to befriend a polar bear you must know these key behavioral patterns.
    <ol> <li>Polar bears have problems overheating and typically walk at a slower pace to keep cool. <strong> Never rush a polar bear!</strong></li> 
<li> Similar to humans polar bears sleep 7-8 hours a day, and they love their <strong> naps!! </strong> So if you love to sleep a polar bear might be the perfect companion. </li> 
<li>Polar bears like to <strong>stay clean</strong>, because dirty matted fur isn't a good insulator. Polar bears will spend 15 minutes putting the head into open water and licking their paws, chest, and muzzles.
So make sure to stay clean if you wish to befriend a polar bear!</li>
<li> The final thing you ned to know is how Polar Bear communicate. Communication is key in befriending a polar bear. For example Polar bears head wagging from side to side is a sign they want to play with you, 
    nose to nose greetings means they want your food, and chuffing is a vocal response polar bears give out when their stress, so make sure to give your new best friend a hg to calm them down.
